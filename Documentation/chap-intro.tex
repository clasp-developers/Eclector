\sysname{} is a portable, implementation-independent version of the
\commonlisp{} function \texttt{read}, a corresponding readtable and a
quasiquotation facility.  As opposed to existing
implementation-specific version of \texttt{read}, \sysname{} uses
generic functions to allow clients to customize the exact behavior,
such as the interpretation of tokens.

Furthermore, \sysname{} can be used as a \texttt{source tracking}
reader, which is accomplished through the use of \emph{concrete syntax
  trees}%
\footnote{See: https://github.com/robert-strandh/Concrete-Syntax-Tree}
which wrap the \commonlisp{} expressions in standard instances that
can also contain information about the positions in the source code of
those expressions.
